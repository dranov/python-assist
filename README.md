# python-assist
Hackathon project to make Python coding more accessible to blind programmers


## NVDA plugin

To install the assistant as a global NVDA add-on, copy the `python-assist.py` file in your NVDA configuration folder.

You can find your NVDA configuration folder:
 * by opening "_Explore NVDA configuration files_" in the Windows Start Menu (if NVDA is installed)
 * in the `userConfig/` folder inside the NVDA directory (if you're running a portable version of NVDA).
 
 To reload the plugin after editing the `.py` file, open the NVDA menu and click _Tools -> Reload plugins_.
